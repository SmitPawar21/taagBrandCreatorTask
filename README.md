## Brandâ€“Creator Matching Logic

The core of this project is a **matching engine** that pairs brands with the most suitable creators.  
The matching is based on a **100-point scoring system** across four dimensions:

**Total Score = Relevance (40) + Audience Fit (30) + Performance/Price (20) + Constraints (10) = 100**

---

### 1. Relevance (40 points)
- **Category Match (20 pts):** Brandâ€™s category compared with creatorâ€™s past categories & verticals.  
- **Tone Match (10 pts):** Brandâ€™s tone vs. creatorâ€™s content tone.  
- **Platform Match (10 pts):** Brandâ€™s preferred platforms vs. creatorâ€™s active platforms.  

**Scoring Method:**  
- Category: `(matches / totalCategories) * 20`  
- Tone: `(matches / totalTones) * 10`  
- Platform: `(matches / totalPlatforms) * 10`

---

### 2. Audience Fit (30 points)
- **Target Location (15 pts):** Brandâ€™s target locations compared with creatorâ€™s `audienceGeo`.  
  - For each city matched, add its audience % contribution and then scale to 15.  
- **Target Age (15 pts):** Brandâ€™s target ages vs. creatorâ€™s `audienceAge`.  
  - The closer the overlap, the higher the score (scaled to 15).  

---

### 3. Performance & Price (20 points)
- **Engagement Rate (5 pts):**  
  - `0â€“0.5% â†’ 1`, `0.5â€“1% â†’ 2`, `1â€“2% â†’ 3`, `2â€“3% â†’ 4`, `>3% â†’ 5`  
- **Average Views (5 pts):**  
  - `0â€“1k â†’ 1`, `1kâ€“5k â†’ 1.5`, `5kâ€“10k â†’ 2`, `10kâ€“50k â†’ 2.5`, `50kâ€“100k â†’ 3`, `100kâ€“250k â†’ 4`, `>250k â†’ 5`  
- **Budget Match (10 pts):**  
  - If creatorâ€™s `basePrice` â‰¤ brandâ€™s budget â†’ score based on affordability.  
  - Example: Closer the price to budget (without exceeding), higher the score.  

---

### 4. Constraints (10 points)
- Example: If brand prohibits adult content and creator produces adult content â†’ 0 pts.  
- If both align on content safety â†’ full 10 pts.  

---

### Flow
1. Take brand details from `req.body`.  
2. Fetch all creators from DB.  
3. Compute a score (0â€“100) for each creator.  
4. Sort creators by score and return the ranked list.

4. **Billing & Payout Workflow**  
   - The `BillingPage` uses a **stepper** UI:  
     - **Step 1:** Brand Billing (company, GST, budget, payment method, etc.)  
     - **Step 2:** Creator Payout (prefilled creator details + payout information)  
     - **Step 3:** Summary (final review of billing + payout before confirmation)  

This approach ensures a **smooth brand â†’ creator â†’ billing â†’ payout journey** without data loss or confusion.
